# Urban Sound Classification (10 Classes)

## Description  
This project focuses on **classifying urban sounds into 10 categories** using audio signal processing and deep learning. Spectrograms are generated from raw audio files and then used as input to a neural network for classification.  

## Files  
- `UrbanSoundClassification.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter notebook with the full implementation  
- Dataset: UrbanSound8K (10 sound classes)  

## Features  
- Audio preprocessing and spectrogram generation  
- Deep learning network for urban sound classification  
- Classification into **10 urban sound categories**  
- Model training, testing, and evaluation with accuracy metrics  

## Classes  
The 10 urban sound classes are:  
1. Air Conditioner  
2. Car Horn  
3. Children Playing  
4. Dog Bark  
5. Drilling  
6. Engine Idling  
7. Gun Shot
